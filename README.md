YT2MP3Sharp is an app built by me as there are not to many out there :wink:.



This is just an UI  written in C#([.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)) with [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia), [YoutubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) libraries and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) as dependency.

To build do:
- ```dotnet restore```
- ```dotnet build -c Release```
- go to Release folder and put your FFMpeg executable there.



Download ffmpeg from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
