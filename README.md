YT2MP3Sharp is an app built by me as there are not to many out there :wink:.

[![.NET](https://github.com/VLDG2712/YT2MP3Sharp-Avalonia/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/VLDG2712/YT2MP3Sharp-Avalonia/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)

This is just an UI  written in C# with AvaloniaUI, YoutubeExplode libraries and ffmpeg as dependency.

To build do:
- ```dotnet restore```
- ```dotnet build -c Release```
- go to Release folder and put your FFMpeg executable there



Download ffmpeg from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
