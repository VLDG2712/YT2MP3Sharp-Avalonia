YT2MP3Sharp is an app built by me as there are not to many out there :wink:.



This is just an UI  written in C#([![.NET](https://github.com/VLDG2712/YT2MP3Sharp-Avalonia/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/VLDG2712/YT2MP3Sharp-Avalonia/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)) with [AvaloniaUI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia), [YoutubeExplode](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) libraries and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) as dependency.

To build do:
- ```dotnet restore```
- ```dotnet build -c Release```
- go to Release folder and put your FFMpeg executable there



Download ffmpeg from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
